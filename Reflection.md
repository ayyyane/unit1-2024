# Reflection

## What worked well?
I made a lot effort to understand code. I didn't study about python before I joined this class, so I couldn't understand what I did at first few weeks.
As I asked freinds and reserch on the internet a lot, it is much better to understand.I sepent the most time studing Python in 6 subjects.

## what needs inprovement?
I want to remember completely the codes I learned. Even I used them, I forgot most of them.

## what is your goal for unit2?

## how will you get to the goal?
